    <h1>About Me...</h1>
    <p>My name is Parker Randall. I am 23 years old and I am currently a web development student. I grew up in Southern California my whole life. Sports has always been my passion, even though I didn't get to play every sport I wanted to. I went to high school in Palm Desert so I played golf most of my life, being that there isn't much else to do out in the desert.</p>

    <p> The sport I've become most passionate about growing up and still to this day is snowboarding. I used to spend my weekends during the winters in Big Bear. Some of my favorite athletes are professional snowboarders such as Torstein Horgmo, whos from Norway and Kazu Kokubo who is from Japan.</p>
